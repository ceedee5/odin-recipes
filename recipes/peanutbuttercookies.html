    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a quick recipe for cookies when you are in a crunch for time and need to have something for the dessert platter now! These are very soft and taste great. 
        I have yet to have anyone toss these cookies back on my platter.</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
        <li> 1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li> Â½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour the cake mix into a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and add peanut butter, oil, eggs, and water. Mix until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten slightly using a fork dipped in water.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cookies set on cookie sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before carefully removing from the cookie sheet to cool on wire racks.</li>
    </ol>
