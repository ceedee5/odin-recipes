    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple, no frills biscotti. My friend at work gave this recipe to me. It's quick, easy and one of my favorite Italian cookie recipes.</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 3 eggs
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and anise flavoring until well blended. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the egg mixture to form a heavy dough. Divide dough into two pieces. Form each piece into a roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack. When The cookies are cool enough to handle, slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices cut side up back onto the baking sheet. Bake for an additional 6 to 10 minutes on each side. Slices should be lightly toasted.</li>
    </ol>
